=============

A utility library for the [Seadragon AJAX viewer] (http://expression.microsoft.com/en-us/gg413362.aspx). The library acts as a bridge between Seadragon AJAX and the [Raphael] (http://raphaeljs.com) JavaScript vector drawing library, so that  Raphael drawing elements can be used as overlays.
